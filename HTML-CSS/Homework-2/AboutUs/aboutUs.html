    <!--ABOUT US TEXT-->
    <h3>We believe nothing should go to waste</h3>

    <p>At Green Resycle, we want to create a truly circular society where nothing goes to <b>waste</b>. We provide reliable 
    <b>waste collection</b>, <b>innovative reuse services</b> and <b>advanced recycling on an industrial level</b>. We also offer comprehensive recycling solutions and circular services, which play a key role in the transition to a circular economy.</p>
        
    <p>With our advanced recycling processes, we transform huge quantities of complex waste into 
    <strong>high-quality recycled raw materials</strong> for use in production instead of the Earthâ€™s <b>natural resources</b>. These recycled raw materials include <b>ferrous</b> and <b>non-ferrous metals</b>, <b>plastics</b> and <b>paper</b> and are resold for use in the manufacturing of new products.</p>
