    <!--TEXT FOR RECYCLING-->
    <p>Overconsumption and a throwaway culture have led to a <b>global waste crisis</b>. While even complex trash is technically recyclable, most materials are <b>not profitable</b> to recycle. As a result, waste piles up in landfills and <b>pollutes</b> our planet while virgin materials are extracted from the earth to create new products.
    At Green Resycle, our mission is <strong>Eliminating the Idea of Waste</strong>. Businesses, government entities, and people like you work with us globally to keep trash out of landfills or from incineration. Through collaboration and innovation, we've developed the world's first solutions in everything from <b>recycling</b> to <b>reuse</b>.</p> <br>
